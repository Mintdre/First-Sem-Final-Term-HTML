              <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
              <li>1 tsp fish sauce (optional)</li>

    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Slice 250 g chicken or 200 g shrimp (or your preferred protein) into
        bite-sized pieces and pat dry. Wash and cut 1 small carrot diagonally,
        1/2 small cabbage into bite-sized pieces, 1 small broccoli and 1 small
        cauliflower into florets, 1 red and 1 green bell pepper into strips, a
        handful of snow peas (or Baguio beans), and halve 1/2 cup baby corn.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl mix 2 tbsp oyster sauce, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp fish sauce
        (optional), 1 tsp sugar, and 1 cup chicken broth. Dissolve 1 tsp
        cornstarch in 2 tbsp water and set aside to thicken the stir-fry later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tbsp cooking oil in a wok or large pan over medium-high heat,
        then sauté 3 cloves minced garlic and 1/2 sliced onion until fragrant
        and translucent. Be careful not to burn the garlic; reduce the heat
        slightly if it starts to brown too quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the prepared protein to the pan, season lightly with salt and
        pepper, and stir-fry until just cooked through (about 3–5 minutes for
        chicken, less for shrimp). Remove the protein from the pan and set it
        aside to prevent overcooking while you cook the vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pan, add the harder vegetables first — the carrot,
        cauliflower, and broccoli — and stir-fry for 2–3 minutes so they begin
        to soften. If the pan looks dry, splash a tablespoon of broth or oil to
        keep everything moving and prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add bell peppers, snow peas, cabbage, and baby corn to the pan and
        continue stir-frying quickly over high heat to keep them crisp-tender.
        Cook for another 2 minutes until the cabbage wilts slightly but still
        retains some crunch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the prepared sauce into the pan and bring it to a gentle simmer so
        the flavors mingle with the vegetables. Taste and adjust with a little
        more soy or fish sauce if you prefer it saltier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the cornstarch slurry slowly while stirring so the sauce
        thickens to a glossy consistency and coats the vegetables. Return the
        cooked protein to the pan and toss everything together for 1–2 minutes
        until heated through and evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off the heat and season with a grind of black pepper and, if
        desired, a tiny splash of sesame oil for aroma. Give it one final toss
        and transfer to a serving plate to serve immediately with steamed rice.
